FAQ
---
Q: May I use the plugin's source code in my closed-source program?
A: According to the Artistic License 2.0 it is possible only when the plugin
   remains a dynamically linked library (and if this library is modified, its
   source code must be published). It is prohibited to insert the source code
   directly into the closed-code program. However, I'm not a fanatic of the
   ideology of open-source. If you have significant reasons to wish using my
   code in a closed-source project, write me, and maybe I will meet your wishes.
